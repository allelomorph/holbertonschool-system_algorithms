### [(378) 0x00. C - Red-Black trees](./0x00-red_black_tree/)
Introduction to Red-Black Trees: how they differ from other types of Binary Trees, and how to implement tree validation and node insertion/deletion based on their properties. 

### [(392) 0x01. C - Graphs](./0x01-graphs/)
Introduction to Graph Theory: what are vertices and edges, different types of graphs (directed, weighted, etc.), the most common ways of representing graphs in C, and DFS versus BFS traversal.

### [(286) 0x02. C - Huffman coding](./0x02-huffman_coding/)
A review of Min/Max Binary Heaps, plus an introduction to priority queues, Huffman Trees, and Huffman Coding, in service of building a file compression application.

### [(410) 0x03. C - Pathfinding](./0x03-pathfinding/)
Introduction to Pathfinding: its most common applications, backtracking as a class of solutions and how it can be less desireable in graph traversal, Dijkstra’s algorithm and its main weakness, finally the A* algorithm, and its improvements over Dijkstra’s.

### [(196) 0x04. C - N-ary trees](./0x04-nary_trees/)
Introduction to N-ary trees as an extension of previous Binary Tree concepts: node insertion, tree deletion and traversal, measuring the diameter of a tree, and pathfinding from the root node.
